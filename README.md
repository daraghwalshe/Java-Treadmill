# Java-Treadmill
Second year college project: Controller GUI for hospital physio treadmill

#### Group Project with 2 contributors :mortar_board: :two:

This project was developed as a collaboration between myself and Szabolcs. The aim of the project was to create an emulation of controller software for a treadmill located in the physio department of a hospital. The system allows patients to be added with a tailor-made exercise regime. When a user is selected their exercise plan is loaded to the systems treadmill control panel. This can then be executed *or* modified and executed. The interfaces allow comments to be added for patients progress etc.

The logic was developed with Java.SE using the eclipse IDE. The application uses a mySQL database for persistent storage of patient details. A database file has been included for anyone who wants to play about with the code.
